        <h2>Origin Story</h2>
        <img src="./assets/images/table-in-restaurant.jpg">
        <p>It was 1965, at our first location in Los Angeles, CA that Hansa Makornsut set out to open her first of many restaurants at the young age of 27 years old. Since a child her passion was freestyling thai food with a mexican-american fusion which set her apart from the competition. Her creativity fueled a spark in her heart that would soon become a vision of expansion into many different cities that we see around the world today.  </p>
